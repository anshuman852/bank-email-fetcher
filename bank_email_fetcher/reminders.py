"""Payment reminder logic: scheduling, mark-as-paid, and auto-detection.

Payment tracking fields live on StatementUpload directly:
- payment_status: PaymentStatus enum (NULL = no due date)
- payment_sent_offsets: JSON list of reminder day-offsets already sent
- payment_paid_amount: cumulative payment amount
- payment_paid_at: when fully paid

Provides:
- init_payment_tracking(): sets payment_status on a StatementUpload with a due date
- check_and_send_reminders(): poll-loop hook that sends due-date reminders
- handle_mark_paid_callback(): Telegram inline button handler
- check_payment_received(): auto-marks statements paid on incoming credits
